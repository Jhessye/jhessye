HELLO! :D I’m **Jhessye**, a **developer focused on applied computing**, someone who likes systems that actually *do something useful and cool*. I enjoy building things from scratch, understanding how they work internally, and improving them step by step — whether that’s with **Java**, **Python**, or data-driven logic.

I’m especially interested in projects that mix **software development + data + decision-making**, like recommendation systems, simulations, automation tools, games, and small real-world systems.

## About Me :)

*  Developer in training with a strong foundation in **programming logic**
*  Java is my comfort zone (OOP, systems, structure) - even though I don't like coffee 
*  Python is my tool for data, models, and experimentation - love this
*  Interested in **recommendation systems, applied ML, and intelligent software** - THIS HAS HAAAARD
*  I like understanding *why* something works — not just making it run - but sometimes, yes
*  If it’s repetitive, I’ll try to automate it

## 🧠 What I build (until now)

My projects are usually **system-oriented and practical**, mixing code, logic, and experimentation:

* 🎮 **Game systems with Godot**
  Development of gameplay systems using **Godot + GDScript**, focusing on logic, state management, animations, interactions, and clean architecture. I treat games as software systems, not just visuals.

* 🧩 **Java system**
  Inventory management system fully developed in Java, applying object-oriented programming, business logic, database integration, and system organization.

* 🎯 **Recommendation systems**
  KNN-based models, similarity rankings, probability logic, and experiments with real datasets.

* 🐍 **Python projects**
  ETL, data processing, analysis, visualizations, and applied ML experiments.

> I promise to deliver more cool projects.

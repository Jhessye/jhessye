HELLO! ✧.*

      I’m Jhessye 💗, a <strong>developer focused on applied computing</strong>, someone who likes systems that actually <em>do something useful and cool</em>.<br><br>
      I enjoy building things from scratch, understanding how they work internally, and improving them step by step — whether that’s with <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, or data-driven logic.

I’m especially interested in projects that combines all my knowledge, **software development + data + decision-making**, like recommendation systems, simulations, games, some cute stuff and small real-world systems. I’m also passionate about the academic side of computing.

## ![About Me ツ](https://img.shields.io/badge/ABOUT%20ME%20ツ-ff69b4?style=for-the-badge&logo=heart&logoColor=white)

*  Developer in training with a strong foundation in **programming logic**
*  ![LOVE PINK](https://img.shields.io/badge/LOVE%20PINK!-ffc0cb?style=flat-square&logoColor=white)
*  Java is my comfort zone (OOP, systems, structure) - even though I don't like coffee
*  Python is my tool for data, models, and experimentation - love this
*  Interested in **recommendation systems, applied ML, and intelligent software** - THIS HAS HAAAARD
*  I like understanding *why* something works — not just making it run - but sometimes, yes
*  If it’s repetitive, I’ll try to automate it

## ![What I Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/WHAT%20I%20BUILD-ff69b4?style=for-the-badge&logo=heart&logoColor=white) ✧.*

My projects are usually **system-oriented and practical**, mixing code, logic, and experimentation:

* 💗 **Game systems with Godot**
  Development of gameplay systems using **Godot + GDScript**, focusing on logic, state management, animations, interactions, and clean architecture. I treat games as software systems, not just visuals.

* 💗 **Java system**
  Inventory management system fully developed in Java, applying object-oriented programming, business logic, database integration, and system organization.

* 💗 **Recommendation systems**
  KNN-based models, similarity rankings, probability logic, and experiments with real datasets.

* 💗 **Python projects**
  ETL, data processing, analysis, visualizations, and applied ML experiments.

> I promise to deliver more cool projects.
